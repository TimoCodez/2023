### This is a Pomodoro GUI powered by Tkinter
If you want to change the background image you can do so by changing the tomato_img between the 1 and 2 versions

Tkinter and Math are included on the Python installation so no need to pip install anything else

The codebase is separated into named sections.
All global variables are ALL CAPS for easier readability

This app is tweaked version of the Udemy #100daysofpython course app by Angela Yu

Changes:

Added a function to avoid multiple countdowns launched by clicking the Begin button. When the timer is running the begin button is disabled.

Additional features in consideration:

Pause / Continue button => Pauses the timer and starts the timer again from where it was previously.
